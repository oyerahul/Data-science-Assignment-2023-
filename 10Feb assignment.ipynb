    "Question 1:Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening.\n",
    "Answer: In Python, the function used to open a file is `open()`.\n",
    "The different modes of opening a file in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.`\"r\"` (read mode): This mode opens a file for reading only. It raises an error if the file does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.`\"w\"` (write mode): This mode opens a file for writing only. If the file already exists, it truncates the file to zero length. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.`\"a\"` (append mode): This mode opens a file for writing only. If the file already exists, it appends data to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.`\"x\"` (exclusive creation mode): This mode creates a new file and opens it for writing only. If the file already exists, it raises an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.`\"b\"` (binary mode): This mode opens a file in binary mode. It should be used with one of the other modes (e.g., \"rb\" for read mode in binary).\n",
    "\n",
    "Modes can be combined with a plus sign (\"+\") to allow both reading and writing. For example, `\"r+\"` opens the file for both reading and writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that when a file is opened, it should always be closed after use using the close() function.\n"

    "Question 2: Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "Answer : The `close()` function is used to close a file that was previously opened using the `open()` function in Python.\n",
    "It is important to close a file after use for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.To free up system resources: When a file is opened, the operating system assigns resources to handle the file. If a file is not closed after use, these resources will continue to be allocated until the program terminates or the file is closed. This can lead to resource exhaustion, which can cause problems for the operating system and other applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.To ensure data is written to the file: When a file is opened for writing, data is written to an internal buffer until it is written to the file on disk. If the file is not closed properly, the data in the buffer may not be written to the file, which can result in data loss or corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.To prevent accidental modification: If a file is not closed after use, it can still be modified by other programs or users, which can lead to unexpected behavior and errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid these problems, it's important to always close a file after use using the close() function. Alternatively, you can use a context manager (`with open(...)` as file:) to automatically `close` the file when the block of code is exited."
