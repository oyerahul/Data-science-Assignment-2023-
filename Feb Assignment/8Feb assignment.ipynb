    "Answer :The `abc` module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes\". It provides a way to define abstract classes in Python, which are classes that cannot be instantiated directly, but must be subclassed by concrete classes that implement their abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract classes are useful when you want to define a common interface for a group of related classes, but you do not want to provide a default implementation for that interface. This allows you to ensure that all concrete classes that implement the interface have the same set of methods and attributes, making it easier to write code that works with any of those classes.\n",

The `Dog` and `Cat` classes inherit from `Animal` and provide a concrete implementation of the `speak()` method. Since `Dog` and `Cat` implement the `speak()` method, they can be instantiated and used in code that expects an Animal object."

A class can be used to define an abstract data type, which encapsulates data and the operations that can be performed on that data. The class can then be used to create objects, which represent instances of the abstract data type.
