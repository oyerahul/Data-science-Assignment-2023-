    "Question 1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.\n",
    "Answer:In Python, an `exception` is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception occurs, the program stops executing and Python raises an error message, providing information about what went wrong. Exceptions can occur for a variety of reasons, such as invalid input, file not found, network errors, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Syntax errors`, on the other hand, are errors that occur when the Python interpreter cannot parse the code because of incorrect syntax. These errors usually occur before the program is executed and prevent the program from running at all. Examples of syntax errors include misspelled keywords, missing colons, incorrect indentation, and other similar errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key differences between exceptions and syntax errors are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Timing of occurrence: Syntax errors occur before the program starts running, while exceptions occur during program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Cause: Syntax errors are caused by incorrect syntax, whereas exceptions are caused by unexpected situations that occur during program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Handling: Syntax errors must be fixed by correcting the code, while exceptions can be handled by using try-except blocks, which allow you to catch the exception and handle it in a way that allows the program to continue running.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Error message: Syntax errors usually provide a simple error message indicating the line number and type of error, while exceptions can provide more detailed information about the cause of the error, such as a traceback and a description of the error type.\n",
