QUESTION 1:-Who developed python programming language
ANSWER : Guido van Rossum

QUESTION 2:-Which type of programming does python support
ANSWER : Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. 
         Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, 
         and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented
         programming (including metaprogramming and metaobjects)
         
QUESTION 3:-Is python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers.
ANSWER: Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language, i.e., it treats uppercase and lowercase characters differently.
        This applies to identifiers too.
        You must avoid using the same name with different cases while naming identifiers. 
        It is always good to use names that are more easily understood. 
        If you want to store counts of 2 values, you would rather name your variables count1 and count2 
        instead of naming them C and c. 
        Although the latter would give you separate variables, it can cause a lack of understanding in 
        the longer run.
        
QUESTION 5:-is python code compiled or interpreted
ANSWER : python compiled or interpreted both type of language
		 The compilation part is hidden from the programmer thus
         The compilation part is done first when we execute our code and this will generate byte code
         and internally this byte code gets converted by the python virtual
         machine(p.v.m) according to the underlying platform(machine+operating system).
         
QUESTION 6:-name a few blocks of code used to define in python language 
ANSWER: Indentation is used to define a block of code in python. Braces {} are used to define 
        a block of code in most programming languages, like C, C++, and Java. 
        But this indentation makes python unique among all programming languages.
        This indentation highlights the block of code. In Python, 
        indentation is done with whitespace. All statements with the same right-hand distance
        belong to the same code block. If a block needs to be more nested, it is indented to the right.
        
        EXAMPLE:

        name = 'SAURABH'

        if name == 'SAURABH':
            print('Correct Name!!')
        else:
            print('InCorrect Name:(')
        print('HI')
