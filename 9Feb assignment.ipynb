    "Answer .Getters and setters are methods that allow you to access and modify the attributes of an object. In Python, they are commonly used to control access to an object's attributes, ensure that data is stored and retrieved in a consistent way, and enforce constraints on the type and value of data stored in an object's attributes.\n",

The `get_radius` method returns the value of the radius attribute, while the `set_radius` method sets the value of the radius attribute. The `set_radius` method also checks that the value passed to it is positive and raises a ValueError if it is not. This allows you to enforce constraints on the type and value of the data stored in the `radius` attribute."
