    "1. Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "    + Ordinal Encoding assigns unique integers to each category in a categorical variable.\n",
    "    +    The assigned integers are ordered based on the inherent order or priority of the categories.\n",
    "    +    This encoding preserves the ordinal relationship between categories, meaning it captures the notion of higher or lower values.\n",
    "    +    For example,\n",
    "         if you have a variable \"Size\" with categories \"Small,\" \"Medium,\" and \"Large,\" you might assign the integers 0, 1, and 2, respectively.\n",
    "         Label Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Label Encoding:\n",
    "    +    Label Encoding assigns unique integers to each category in a categorical variable without considering any inherent order or priority.\n",
    "    +    The assigned integers are arbitrary and do not preserve any meaningful relationship between categories.\n",
    "    +    For example, \n",
    "         if you have a variable \"Color\" with categories \"Red,\" \"Green,\" and \"Blue,\" you might assign the integers 0, 1, and 2, respectively.\n",
    "     \n",
    "3. When to choose one over the other:\n",
    "    + Ordinal Encoding is suitable when the categorical variable has an inherent order or priority. For instance, in the \"Size\" example mentioned above, Ordinal Encoding is appropriate because there is a clear order among the categories.\n",
    "    + Label Encoding is appropriate when the categorical variable does not have an inherent order or when the order is not significant for the problem at hand. In the \"Color\" example, Label Encoding would be a better choice because the categories do not have a natural order.\n",

    "By understanding the nature and relationships of the categorical variable, you can choose the appropriate encoding method for your specific task."

    "## Target Guided Ordinal Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables based on the target variable's relationship with the categories. It assigns ordinal labels to the categories in a way that captures the target variable's influence on the encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps involved in Target Guided Ordinal Encoding are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the mean or median target value for each category.\n",
    "2. Order the categories based on their mean or median target value.\n",
    "3. Assign ordinal labels (integers) to the categories according to their order.\n",
    "4. Replace the original categorical values with the assigned ordinal labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "This encoding technique is effective in situations where the categorical variable exhibits a strong correlation with the target variable. It can capture the monotonic relationship between the categories and the target, providing valuable information to the machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a dataset of customer reviews for a product, with the target variable indicating whether a review is positive or negative. The categorical variable \"Sentiment\" represents different sentiment categories, such as \"Happy,\" \"Neutral,\" and \"Sad.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply Target Guided Ordinal Encoding in this scenario:\n",
    "1. Calculate the mean or median positive sentiment rate for each category.\n",
    "2. Order the sentiment categories based on their positive sentiment rate, starting from the lowest to the highest.\n",
    "3. Assign ordinal labels to the sentiment categories according to their order, such as 0 for \"Sad,\" 1 for \"Neutral,\" and 2 for \"Happy.\"\n",
    "4. Replace the original sentiment values in the dataset with the assigned ordinal labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using Target Guided Ordinal Encoding, you capture the relationship between the sentiment categories and the positive sentiment rate, allowing the model to learn the impact of different sentiments on the target variable, which can improve predictive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to evaluate the effectiveness of Target Guided Ordinal Encoding on your specific dataset and problem before using it in your machine learning project."
