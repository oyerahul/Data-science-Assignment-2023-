    "`Question 1`. What is the difference between a t-test and a z-test? Provide an example scenario where you would use each type of test. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Answer` :A t-test and a z-test are both statistical tests used to make inferences about population parameters, such as the population mean, based on sample data. However, they differ in terms of when and how they are used. Here's the key difference between the two, along with example scenarios for each type of test:\n",
    "\n",
    "` T-Test:`\n",
    "\n",
    "1.    A t-test is used when you are working with a small sample size (typically less than 30) or when the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    " 2.   It is based on the t-distribution, which has heavier tails than the standard normal (z) distribution. The shape of the t-distribution depends on the degrees of freedom, which is related to the sample size.\n",
    "3.    T-tests are typically used in situations where you have a small sample size or when you need to estimate the population mean with an unknown population standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Example Scenario for a T-Test:`\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to test whether a new teaching method improves student test scores. You randomly select 20 students and measure their test scores before and after implementing the new method. You use a t-test to determine if there is a significant difference in test scores after the intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "` Z-Test:`\n",
    "\n",
    "1.    A z-test is used when you have a larger sample size (typically greater than 30) and you know the population standard deviation, or when you are comparing sample means to a known population mean.\n",
    "2.    It is based on the standard normal (z) distribution, which has a fixed shape with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\n",
    "3.    Z-tests are typically used when working with larger sample sizes and when you have information about the population standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Example Scenario for a Z-Test:`\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to determine if the average height of male students at your university is significantly different from the national average height for adult males, which is known to be 68 inches. You collect height data from a random sample of 100 male students and use a z-test to compare the sample mean to the known population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the choice between a t-test and a z-test depends on the sample size, whether you know the population standard deviation, and the specific research question. If you have a small sample size or an unknown population standard deviation, you typically use a t-test. If you have a larger sample size and know the population standard deviation, a z-test is more appropriate. Both tests are valuable tools for hypothesis testing and making statistical inferences.\n"

    "5.    For example, if you're testing whether a new drug is more effective than an old drug, you might use a one-tailed test looking for evidence that the new drug's effect is \"greater than\" the old drug.\n",

    "`Two-Tailed Test:`\n",

    "\n",
    "t = (6 - 0) / (2.5 / √50)\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Determine the critical value:\n",
    "Since we are using a two-tailed test and a significance level of 0.05, we need to find the critical value that corresponds to an alpha level of 0.025 (0.05 divided by 2) in the t-distribution with (n - 1) degrees of freedom.\n",
